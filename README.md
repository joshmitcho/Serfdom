- Quests
- NPC Relationships & Allegiance
- Economy
- Cutscenes
That should be enough systems to release a true vertical slice of the game as a demo, then I can get started filling out the actual content.

**note:** this repo is for education/archival purposes. It won't run without the art and sound assets, and I don't have the rights to distribute them outside of the game itself. You can download a playable version from the Itch page: https://joshmitcho.itch.io/serfdom
